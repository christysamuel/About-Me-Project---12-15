    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Hi! I'm Christy Samuel, and I'm 17 years old. I was born in Kereal, India (South India). But I moved to America at the age of four, and grew up in Oklahoma since then. Unfortunately, I can't speak my native language, Malayalam, although I can decently understand it.</p>

    <h3>School</h3>
          <img src="images/logo.png" alt="school image" width="130" height="100">
      <p>I'm currently a high school student at Mustang High School in my Senior year! I been in Mustang for most of my educational life, so I'm really familiar to it's rules and environment. Although, as I grow older, I've realized how much more responsibilities pile up on you. Whether you like it or not, you have to face them head-on. Nevertheless, I am quite determined in my education, and I strive to do my best.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Subjects</h3>
      <p>My favorite subjects in school are Math and History. I enjoy the feeling of understanding the new concepts shown to me, it's like a puzzle, it feels worth it in the end. These subjects are more interesting to me, and when I learn them, it's not just about memorizing facts, but truly understanding the material, that really keeps me engaged. I will need Math a lot more for my career, and History is very relevant to know what's happening in the world.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <img src="images/editing.png" alt="editing image" width="175" height="130">
      <p>I'm a person who likes editing or enhancing pictures or videos because it can radiate an aesthetic appeal and you can see the transformation. Then, adding artistic effects can express its beauty. In my free time, I enjoy singing, like karaokes. I perform songs in public and on the internet. I feel like that got me out of my bubble and showcase my talent. To follow up, I would really relish listening to music, making it more enjoyable to discover new artists and genres.</p>

    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
      <p>My future goals include graduating high school, then finishing my basics at my current community college, OCCC, although I am considering working regarding my career path, yet still figuring it out, and eventually transferring to a university, preferably not too far of a distance, where I could commute to my classes and back.</p>
